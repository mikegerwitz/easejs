<p>
  The tarball contains the full source code, combined files for debugging GNU
  ease.js itself, combined files for development using GNU ease.js, minified
  files for production, and scripts needed to rebuild. The production and
  development links contain the JavaScript files needed to run GNU ease.js, the
  latter being unminified to allow easily stepping through the code with a
  debugger.
</p>

<p>
  You should verify the above files using their associated signatures to ensure
  that they have not been altered. This can be done by placing both files in the
  same directory and running the command:
</p>

<blockquote class="shell">
  <span class="shell-start">$</span>
  gpg --verify file.sig
</blockquote>

<p>
  where <tt>file</tt> is the full filename, such as <tt>easejs-latest.tar.gz</tt>. If you do not have
  the public signing key, you may download it by running this command:
</p>

<blockquote class="shell">
  <span class="shell-start">$</span>
  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 8EE30EAB
</blockquote>

<h3>npm</h3>
<p>
  ease.js is available via npm for use with Node.js.  Please be warned that
  package signature checks are not performed by npm.
</p>

<blockquote class="shell">
  <span class="shell-start">$</span> npm install easejs
</blockquote>
