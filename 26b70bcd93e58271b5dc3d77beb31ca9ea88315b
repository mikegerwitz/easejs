It's rather interesting looking back on commits.

The second paragraph mentions that ease.js "isn't anything special". Indeed, at
the time of that commit, ease.js was a very simple project. It has since evolved
to be a much more unique project. In that regard, the GPL could have been
appropriate in the sense that no other project exists that is quite like the
current incarnate of ease.js.  However, I still stand behind my decision to use
the LGPL for this project for the sake of adoption. I do not want non-copyleft
libraries to arise that could be used in place of ease.js that would restrict
users' freedoms. More permissive licenses that I commonly see used for JS
libraries (e.g. MIT/Expat) would permit proprietary derivatives, which is
unacceptable.

Therefore, my decisions is intended to enforce freedom.

(Another noteworthy correction is that glibc is not released under the LGPL
because of more permissive licenses; that was the ease.js reason. glibc is
released under the LGPL to encourage others to adopt it over other proprietary
libraries.)
